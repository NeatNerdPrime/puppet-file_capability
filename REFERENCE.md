## Resource types

### file_capability

Set file capabilities on Linux. A file capability allows running a program
with elevated privileges without the need to make that executable a setuid
binary. Capabilities allow a more fine grained definition of privileges
for a program. See the capabilities(7) manpage for an overview of Linux
capabilities.

The capability parameter can be a string if only one capability should be
defined and an array for managing multiple capabilities.

The implemented provider uses the 'setcap' program to check if the current
and the defined capabilities are in sync. In some cases the textual
represemtation may look different when in fact the capabilities are
correctly set. By using the 'setcap' program this is handled correctly
by the operating system.

Example:

    file_capability { '/bin/ping':
      ensure     => present,
      capability => 'cap_net_raw=ep',
    }

In this example, Puppet will ensure the ping executable has the correct
capability to be able to open raw sockets without running setuid.

    file_capability { '/usr/bin/dumpcap':
      capability => 'cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=eip',
    }

This example shows how to set the Effective, Inheritable and Permitted
flags for two capabilities at the same time. This ensures the executable
used by the Wireshark network sniffer can be used by an ordinary user.

    file_capability { 'scanner-access-permissions':
      ensure     => present,
      file       => '/usr/local/sbin/scanner',
      capability => [ 'CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=ep', 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN=ep', ],
    }

This example sets the capabilities to bypass file read permission checks
and perform additional system administration operations for an
hypothetical scanner executable.

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `file_capability` type.

##### `ensure`

Valid values: present, absent

Specifies whether the file capability should exist.

Default value: present

##### `capability`

The capabilities to ensure for the file. This parameter is mandatory
for ensure => 'present'. The parameter can be a string if only one
capability should be set and an array to define multiple capabilities.
Each capability consists of one or more capability names separated by
commas, an operator '=', '+' or '-' and capability flags. Valid flags
are 'e', 'i' or 'p' for the Effective, Inheritable and Permitted sets.
Flags must be given in lowercase.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `file_capability` type.

##### `file`

The name of the file for which the capabilities should be managed.
Default is the resource title. The file will be autorequired if it is
managed by Puppet.
